                <h2>About MSP</h2>
                <p>Minimum Support Price (MSP) is a vital market intervention by the Government of India to safeguard agricultural producers against sharp falls in farm prices. This guarantee ensures fair compensation for farmers and promotes sustainable agriculture practices.</p>
                <p>Our initiative focuses on providing transparent pricing information and support for local farmers, helping them make informed decisions about their crops.</p>

                <h2>Importance of Horticulture</h2>
                <p>Horticulture plays a crucial role in South Indian agriculture, contributing significantly to food security, nutrition, and economic opportunities. Our focus is on preserving and promoting local varieties of fruits and vegetables.</p>
                <p>Through MSP support, we help maintain biodiversity in agricultural practices while ensuring farmers receive fair compensation for their produce.</p>
